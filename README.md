# Tidal Love numbers of Gravitational Atoms
This repository contains code that can be used to compute the tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms. It refers to the work with arXiv number 24XX.XXXXX, which we ask to cite if you use this code.

The user need only call the function Lovenumber[n,li,mi,l], where {n,li,mi} are the numbers that describe the gravitational atom, while l is the index of the multipolar field that is being tidally induced on the atom. The correct expression for the Love number can be found by applying equation F21 in the work mentioned above, and is ultimately computed using the expressions present in Appendix F.2.
